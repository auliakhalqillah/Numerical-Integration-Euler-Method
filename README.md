# Numerical Integration: Euler Method
Euler method is one of the numeric integration methods to solve ordinary differential equation (ODE).

# Usage
The first derivative equation is 

![f'(t) = 2-exp(-4t)-2y](https://i.upmath.me/svg/f'(t)%20%3D%202-exp%5E%7B-4t%7D-2y) 

with initial condition 

![y(0) = 1](https://i.upmath.me/svg/y(0)%3D1) 

is used to solve the intergration problem in this case. If this equation is integrated by exact, we get the general solution from this equation is 

![f(t) = 1 + 0.5exp(-4t) - 0.5exp(-2t)](https://i.upmath.me/svg/f(t)%20%3D%201%20%2B%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dexp%5E%7B-4t%7D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dexp%5E%7B-2t%7D). 

To get the soultion of thi equation, you can go to the [solving first derivative equation with initial value problem](https://www.slideshare.net/AuliaKhalqillah1/solving-first-derivative-equation).

There are three parameters input:
  - Initial Boundary = 0
  - Final Boundary = 5
  - Step of Data = 0.1
 
There are five variables output:
  - t is point data
  - df(t) is first derivative function 
  - fa(t) is exact/analytical integration
  - y(t) is numerical integration by using euler method
  - error is error calculation

The result of this example is shown in Figure bellow
